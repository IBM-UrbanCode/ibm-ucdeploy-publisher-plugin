Note: This is not the plugin distributable! This is the source code. To find the installable plugin, go to the plug-in page on the [IBM UrbanCode Plug-ins microsite](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins).

### License
This plug-in is protected under the [Eclipse Public 1.0 License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)

### Overview
Jenkins is a continuous integration server that supports interactions with other technologies by using a plug-in model.

This plug-in is installed into the Jenkins server and provides the ability to publish artifacts into an IBM UrbanCode Deploy component as a post-build action.

### Documentation
All plug-in documentation is updated and maintained on the [IBM UrbanCode Plug-ins microsite](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins).

### Support
Plug-ins downloaded directly from the [IBM UrbanCode Plug-ins microsite](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins) are fully supported by IBM. Create a GitHub Issue or Pull Request for minor requests and bug fixes. For time sensitive issues that require immediate assistance, [file a PMR](https://www-947.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/newServiceRequest.action) through the normal IBM support channels. Plug-ins built externally or modified with custom code are supported on a best-effort-basis using GitHub Issues.

### Locally Build the Plug-in
This open source plug-in uses Gradle as its build tool. [Install the latest version of Gradle](https://gradle.org/install) to build the plug-in locally. Build the plug-in by running the `gradle jpi` command in the plug-in's root directory. The plug-in distributable will be placed under the `build/libs` folder.
